# Comprehensive Analysis of Crop Yield Prediction and Input Optimization Using Machine Learning

## Introduction

This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to predict crop yield, optimize input usage, and assist in agricultural decision-making. It includes detailed analyses and tools for:

- Predicting the effect of annual rainfall on crop yield.
- Recommending optimal fertilizer and pesticide usage.
- Yield prediction based on state-specific conditions.

A user-friendly interface was developed using Tkinter for real-time interaction and predictions.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Normalized numerical inputs.
   - One-hot encoded categorical variables (e.g., Crop, Season).
   - Handled missing values effectively.

2. **Model Development**
   - Chosen Model: Regression Forest for its accuracy and interpretability.
   - Metrics: High R², low MAE and MSE validated the model's reliability.

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Combined features to model interactions.
   - Incorporated regional and seasonal trends.
